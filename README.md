# Work-Day-Planner

** When a user opens the planner, the times of day are color coded based on whether they are in the future, past, or the present time.

** When a user clicks on a time slot, they are then able to add notes for that time slot

** When the user clicks the save button the notes are saved into local storage, and will persist even when they refresh the page.
